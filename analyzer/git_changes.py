# GIT CHANGES MODULE
# This module contains functions for interacting with Git repositories.
# It uses Git commands to find out which files have changed in a commit
# or pull request.
# =============================================================================

    Get a list of files that changed in a Git commit or range.
    
    This function runs a Git command to find out which files were
    modified, added, or deleted in a specific commit or range of commits.
    
    Args:
        repo_path: Path to the Git repository (default: current directory)
        commit_range: Git commit range to check (default: last commit)
                      Examples: "HEAD~1..HEAD", "main..feature-branch"
    
    Returns:
        A list of file paths (relative to the repository root) that changed.
        Returns an empty list if the Git command fails.
    
    Example:
        # Get files changed in the last commit
        files = get_changed_files()
        
        # Get files changed between two branches
        files = get_changed_files(commit_range="main..my-feature")

    Separate changed files into source code and configuration files.

    into config_files even if its extension is also a source extension.
